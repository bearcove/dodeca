A fully incremental static site generator built with Rust.

**Zero reloads.** When you edit content, dodeca patches the DOM surgically via WASM. No flash of white. No scroll position lost.

**Truly incremental.** Powered by [Salsa](https://salsa-rs.github.io/salsa/), dodeca only rebuilds what actually changed.
