Dodeca is a fully incremental static site generator.

## Overview

This crate provides the `ddc` CLI and the core runtime that powers Dodeca’s build
pipeline, including cells, hot-reload, and devtools integration.

## Features

- Incremental builds with fine‑grained caching
- Cell-based pipeline for content processing
- Live reload and devtools support
- Cross-platform and workspace-friendly

## Usage

Install from the workspace:

- `cargo install --path crates/dodeca`

Run on a site directory:

- `ddc serve /path/to/site`
- `ddc build /path/to/site`

## Workspace

This crate is part of the `dodeca` workspace. Most users should interact with
the `ddc` CLI rather than depending on this crate directly.
