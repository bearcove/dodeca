# livereload-client

WASM client for dodeca live reload. It connects to the devtools server, receives DOM patch messages, and applies them in the browser to update pages without a full reload.

## What it does

- Opens a websocket connection to dodeca devtools
- Receives patch messages encoded with `dodeca-protocol`
- Applies DOM patches using `hotmeal-wasm`

## Usage

This crate is built and bundled by the workspace tooling; you typically don’t depend on it directly.
