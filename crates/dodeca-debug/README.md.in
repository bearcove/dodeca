## dodeca-debug

Low-level debug utilities used across the dodeca workspace.

This crate hosts small, platform-focused helpers (for example, OS-specific
introspection or debugging primitives) that don’t belong in higher-level
crates.

### Status

Internal crate used by the workspace. Not intended for direct consumption.
