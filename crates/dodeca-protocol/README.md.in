## dodeca-protocol

Shared protocol types for dodeca devtools. This crate contains the data structures
and serialization formats used by the devtools runtime and the live reload client.

### What this crate is for

- Defining stable protocol types shared across dodeca components
- Encoding and decoding messages for devtools communication
- Keeping compatibility boundaries explicit and versioned

### When to use it

Use `dodeca-protocol` when you need to serialize or interpret messages exchanged
between dodeca devtools components (e.g. host <-> client).

This crate is internal to the dodeca workspace and is not intended for standalone use.
