# Cylinder objects

A cylinder is a stylized projection of a cylinder into the 2-D space of
the diagram.  Cylinders are commonly used to represent bulk data storage in
software architecture diagrams, as legacy disk packs were cylindrical in shape.

The shape of a cylinder is defined by the width, height, and radius.
The radius is the minor axis of the ellipse that forms the top of the
cylinder, and the semiellipse the forms the bottom.
